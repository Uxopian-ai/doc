# Global Statistics

The **Statistics** page provides a high-level overview of your system's health, usage trends, and Return on Investment (ROI).

## Time Interval Selector

All time-based views support a configurable **time interval**. Use the interval selector to adjust the granularity of the data:

| Interval | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `HOUR`   | Hourly breakdown (useful for monitoring recent activity). |
| `DAY`    | Daily aggregation (default). |
| `WEEK`   | Weekly summary. |
| `MONTH`  | Monthly overview. |
| `YEAR`   | Yearly totals. |

The selected interval applies to the Usage Trends view and is passed as the `interval` query parameter when calling the statistics API.
