## Key Features

- **Unified LLM Gateway**  
  Interact with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, etc.) through a single, consistent REST API.

- **Powerful Templating**  
  Use the dynamic templating engine (Thymeleaf) to create sophisticated, reusable prompts that can react to context and call internal services.

- **Stateful Conversations**  
  Automatically manage conversation history to provide context for follow-up questions, enabling natural and fluid interactions.

- **Goal-Driven Logic**  
  Orchestrate complex tasks with *Goals* that intelligently select the right prompt based on conditional logic and the data you provide.

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  Add new LLM providers without modifying the core code, thanks to a simple plugin system.

- **Flexible Deployment**  
  Deploy as a Docker container for a standardized setup or as a standalone Java 21 application.

- **MCP Server Client**  
  Use uxopian-ai as a client for an MCP (Multi-Content Platform) server, enabling seamless content interaction.

- **Custom Template Helpers**  
  Extend the templating engine by adding your own custom Java functions (helpers) to be used directly within your prompts.
